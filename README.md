# flask-react-redux-project

In this project I have used react with redux as front-end and flask as backend.
On component in this project is an image slider that was built using react.
And for the other component, I am grabbing the latest news using the news API. You can also search for the specific keywords in the search bar and it will grab all the news related to that keyword. For this I have used react and redux.
